django-base-project
===================
This is a base django project that comes with everything we need to get started on fun, innovative stuff. 

**Note:** You'll notice that the entire project is sprinkled with the `{{ project_name }}` template tag. This enables the entire codebase to be used as a base template when running the `startproject` command.

## Features ##

By default, this project template includes:

Templating:
- django_compressor for compressing javascript/css/less/sass

Security:
- hashlib
- m2crypto

Background Tasks:
- Celery

Migrations:
- Django built-in migrations (Django >=1.7)

Caching:
- django-redis

Testing:
- pytest
- pytest-coverage

Authentication:
- python-social-auth for OAuth with social networks

Amazon:
- boto for integration with AWS

Any of these options can added, modified, or removed as you like after creating your project.

## Structure/Organization

This template follows the default folder structure recommended by Django:

```
{{ project_name }}/ <-- this'll be auto-generated when you start a project (see below)
|---ansible/
|   |---plugins/
|   |---roles/
|   |   |---webserver/ <-- setup Nginx
|   |---site.yml
|   |---webserver.yml
|   |
|---{{ project_name }}/
|   |---.rcfile <-- config for your pylint needs.
|   |---docs/
|   |   |---_build <-- auto-generated by Makefile.
|   |   |---_static
|   |   |---_templates
|   |   |---conf.py <-- edit this file for default doc values.
|   |   |---Makefile
|   |---sample_app/ 
|   |   |---__init__.py
|   |  	|---models/ 
|   |  	|   |---sample_model.py <-- each model should be its own file.
|   |  	|---static/ <-- all app specific static assets go here.
|   |  	|   |---css/
|   |  	|   |---images/
|   |  	|   |---js/
|   |  	|---tests <-- all tests for sample_app should go here.
|   |  	|   |---test_sample_app.py
|   |   |---urls.py
|   |   |---views.py
|   |-- settings/
|	|	|---__init__.py
|	|	|---common.py <-- common settings shared by all environments.
|	|	|---local.py
|	|	|---dev.py
|	|	|---qa.py
|	|	|---staging.py
|	|	|---production.py
|	|---static_common/ <-- (optional) shared static assets by different apps go here.
|	|	|---css/
|	|	|---images/
|	|	|---js/
|   |---manage.py
|   |---requirements.txt <-- all required packages for your Django project to work.
|   |---user-data.json <-- fixture to create your admin user.
```

### Philosophy

This folder structure enables us to follow Django's principle of an application:
> The term **application** describes a Python package that provides some set of features. Applications may be *reused* in various projects.

This means that every application should be self contained and pluggable into any Django project. This is why each app has it's own `static` and `tests` folder. In the event that you have static assets that can be shared between two more or more applications, you can either keep separate copies in each app, or move them one level higher into the `static-commons` folder.

## Code Quality

### Pylint

This Django project comes with a pre-configured rcfile for linting purposes. Edit it to your liking. The project should already be free of any PEP8 warnings and errors.

To lint, just run:

```shell
cd {{ project_name }}
pylint --rcfile=.rcfile *
```

## Documentation

This project comes with a pre-configured `Spinx` Makefile. You can edit the conf.py to fit your documentation purposes. 

To auto-generate documentation for your project:

```shell
cd {{ project_name }}/docs
make html
```

You should see the following output:

```shell
sphinx-build -b html -d _build/doctrees   . _build/html

```

As noted in the above console, your documentation will be built into the _build folder.

## Installation

Python 3.4 is required. If you don't have Python 3.4 or higher, download the appropriate package and install:

```shell
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.4.3/python-3.4.3-macosx10.6.pkg
```

Then install virtualenv:

```shell
sudo pip3 install virtualenv
```

Create a virtualenv for {{ project_name }}:

```shell
virtualenv -p <PYTHON_3_PATH> ~/virtualenvs/{{ project_name }}
source ~/virtualenvs/{{ project_name }}/bin/activate
```

Install Django into the virtualenv:

```shell
~/virtualenvs/{{ project_name }}/bin/pip3 install Django
```

Create a new Django project using this project as a base template:

```shell
django-admin.py startproject --template=https://github.com/Appdynamics/django-base-project/archive/master.zip --extension=py,rst,html,config {{ project_name }}
```

Now, install the rest of the packages that are required by your Django project:

```shell
cd {{ project_name }}
~/virtualenvs/{{ project_name }}/bin/pip3 install -r {{ project_name }}/requirements.txt
```

## Deployment

### Local 
When running the project locally for the first time, you need to setup the database.

Activate your virtualenv:
```shell
source ~/virtualenvs/{{ project_name }}/bin/activate
```

Setup the database. Locally, this will create a new sqllite database

```shell
cd {{ project_name }}
python3 manage.py migrate
```

Load initial data. This will create a base admin user with `admin` as the username and `changeme` as the password.

```shell
python3 manage.py loaddata user-data.json
```

### Ansible
If you want to deploy this Django app onto an EC2 instance, you can use the provided ansible playbook to do so:

```shell
ansible-playbook -i ec2.py -l<ec2_hostname>
```

### AWS Elastic Beanstalk

This project is ready to deploy in Elastic Beanstalk. All you need is to set your AWS credentials like so:

```shell
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="<your_aws_access_key>"
export AWS_SECRET_KEY="<your_aws_secret_key>"
```

Next, initialize your project for Elastic Beanstalk:

```
eb init
```

Finally, deploy your code!

```
eb deploy
```

For more information on deploying a Django app into Elastic Beanstalk, you can visit AWS's documentation here: 

1. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create_deploy_Python_django.html

## Testing

In the provided sample app `sample_app`, there's a tests directory that implements some sample test cases that show how different test classes can be leveraged by the Django application. 

To start the tests, simply run:
```shell
python3 manage.py test
```

You should see the following output:

```shell
python3 manage.py test
Creating test database for alias 'default'...
...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 3 tests in 3.049s

OK
Destroying test database for alias 'default'...
```

### Selenium Testing

This project also provides the `selenium` so you can quickly spin up your site (on a different port) and test it against various browsers.

```shell
python3 manage.py test {{ project_name }}.sample_app.SampleSeleniumTests
```

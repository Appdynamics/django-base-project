```

Then install virtualenv:

```
sudo pip3 install virtualenv
```

Create a virtualenv:

```
virtualenv -p <PYTHON_3_PATH> ~/virtualenvs/django-base-project
source ~/virtualenvs/django-base-project/bin/activate
~/virtualenvs/django-base-project/bin/pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

|   |---sample_app/ 
|   |   |---____init____.py
|   |  	|---models.py
|   |  	|---tests.py <-- all your tests for sample_app should go here.

```

# Deployment

## Local 
When running the project locally for the first time, you need to setup the database.

Activate your virtualenv:
```
source ~/virtualenvs/django-base-project/bin/activate
```

Setup the database. Locally, this will create a new sqllite database

```
cd django_base_project
python3 manage.py migrate
```

Load initial data. This will create a base admin user with `admin` as the username and `changeme` as the password.

```
cd django_base_project
python3 manage.py loaddata user-data.json
```

## Elastic Beanstalk

This project is ready to deploy in Elastic Beanstalk. All you need is to set your AWS credentials like so:

```
magic!
```

Next, initialize your project for Elastic Beanstalk:

```
eb init
```

Finally, deploy your code!

```
eb deploy
```

# Testing

In the provided sample app `sample_app`, we provided test.py that provides some sample test cases that show our certain test classes can be leveraged in your Django application. 

To start the tests, simply run:
```
python3 manage.py test
```

## Selenium Testing

This project also provides the `selenium` so you can quickly spin up your site (on a different port) and test it against various browsers.

```
python3 manage.py test django_base_project.sample_app.SampleSeleniumTests
```

"""
A model is the single, definitive source of data about your data. It contains the essential fields
and behaviors of the data youâ€™re storing. Django follows the DRY Principle. The goal is to define your 
data model in one place and automatically derive things from it.

This includes the migrations - unlike in Ruby On Rails, for example, migrations are entirely derived 
from your models file, and are essentially just a history that Django can roll through to update your
database schema to match your current models.
